# ActiveRecord - How Models Talk to Databases

In the MVC tutorial, you learned that models are the "brain" of your app - where business logic lives. But we glossed over something magical: when you write `User.find(1)`, how does Rails know to talk to the database? How does it know which table? How does it turn a database row into a Ruby object you can call methods on?

The answer is **ActiveRecord** - Rails' ORM. Understanding it is the difference between copying code from tutorials and actually knowing what you're doing.

## What Is an ORM? (And Why Next.js Doesn't Have One)

### The Problem ORMs Solve

Databases speak SQL. Ruby speaks... Ruby. They're completely different languages.

Without an ORM, you'd write code like this:

```ruby
# WITHOUT an ORM - raw SQL everywhere
result = database.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1")
user_data = result.first
user_name = user_data["name"]
user_email = user_data["email"]

# Want to update? More SQL strings:
database.execute("UPDATE users SET name = 'New Name' WHERE id = 1")

# Want related data? Even more SQL:
messages = database.execute("SELECT * FROM messages WHERE creator_id = 1")
```

This is tedious, error-prone, and you're constantly context-switching between Ruby and SQL.

### What an ORM Does

**ORM = Object-Relational Mapper**

It maps:
- **Database tables** → Ruby classes
- **Table rows** → Ruby objects
- **Table columns** → Object attributes

```ruby
# WITH ActiveRecord (Rails' ORM)
user = User.find(1)           # Returns a Ruby object
user.name                     # Just access attributes
user.update(name: "New Name") # No SQL strings!
user.messages                 # Related data, automatically
```

The ORM translates your Ruby into SQL behind the scenes. You think in objects, not tables.

### Why Next.js Doesn't Ship With One

You're right that Next.js doesn't include an ORM - and this is a fundamental difference in philosophy.

**Next.js** is a *React framework*. It handles:
- Routing
- Server-side rendering
- API routes
- Build optimization

It deliberately doesn't have opinions about your database. You bring your own: Prisma, Drizzle, raw SQL, a headless CMS, whatever.

**Rails** is a *full-stack framework*. It handles:
- Routing
- Controllers
- Views
- **AND the database layer (ActiveRecord)**

Rails says: "Here's how you do databases. It's already set up. It follows conventions. Just use it."

This is why Rails developers can be productive so quickly - the decisions are made for you. It's also why the "Rails way" exists: ActiveRecord's conventions shape how you think about data.

## The Naming Magic (Convention Over Configuration)

This is where Rails feels like magic. Look at this model:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
end
```

That's it. Two lines. But Rails already knows:

| What Rails Infers | How It Knows |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Table name: `users` | Class `User` → pluralize → `users` |
| Primary key: `id` | Convention (every table has `id`) |
| All columns as attributes | Reads the database schema |
| Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at` | Convention |

You don't configure any of this. The naming IS the configuration.

**From Campfire's database** (`db/structure.sql:67`):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "users" (
  "id" integer PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
  "name" varchar NOT NULL,
  "email_address" varchar DEFAULT NULL,
  "password_digest" varchar DEFAULT NULL,
  "active" boolean DEFAULT 1,
  "bio" text DEFAULT NULL,
  ...
);
```

Because the table is `users` and the class is `User`, ActiveRecord connects them automatically. Every column becomes an attribute:

```ruby
user = User.find(1)
user.name           # From the 'name' column
user.email_address  # From the 'email_address' column
user.active?        # Boolean columns get ? methods for free
user.bio            # From the 'bio' column
```

## CRUD Operations

ActiveRecord makes the four fundamental operations trivial:

### Create

```ruby
# These all work:
user = User.create(name: "Alice", email_address: "alice@example.com")

# Or in two steps:
user = User.new(name: "Alice")
user.save

# With a block:
User.create do |u|
  u.name = "Alice"
  u.email_address = "alice@example.com"
end
```

**SQL generated:** `INSERT INTO users (name, email_address, created_at, updated_at) VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com', '2024-01-15 10:30:00', '2024-01-15 10:30:00')`

### Read

```ruby
User.find(1)              # Find by ID (raises error if not found)
User.find_by(name: "Alice") # Find by any attribute (returns nil if not found)
User.where(active: true)  # Returns a collection
User.first                # First record
User.last                 # Last record
User.all                  # Everything (careful with large tables!)
```

### Update

```ruby
user.update(name: "New Name")
# or
user.name = "New Name"
user.save
```

### Delete

```ruby
user.destroy      # Runs callbacks, deletes associated records
user.delete       # Just deletes, no callbacks (use carefully)
```

## Associations: Relationships Between Models

This is where ActiveRecord truly shines. In Campfire, look at how models connect:

### Example 1: User has many rooms through memberships

**Location:** `app/models/user.rb:4-6`

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :memberships, dependent: :delete_all
  has_many :rooms, through: :memberships
end
```

**What this does:**

```ruby
user = User.find(1)
user.memberships  # All membership records for this user
user.rooms        # All rooms the user belongs to (skipping through memberships)
```

The `through:` is the magic. The database has:
- `users` table
- `memberships` table (with `user_id` and `room_id`)
- `rooms` table

ActiveRecord joins them automatically. You never write the SQL.

### Example 2: Message belongs to room and creator

**Location:** `app/models/message.rb:4-5`

```ruby
class Message < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :room, touch: true
  belongs_to :creator, class_name: "User", default: -> { Current.user }
end
```

**What this demonstrates:**

- `belongs_to :room` - Every message has one room. The `messages` table has a `room_id` column.
- `belongs_to :creator, class_name: "User"` - The column is `creator_id`, but the model is `User` (not `Creator`)
- `touch: true` - When a message is saved, update the room's `updated_at` timestamp
- `default: -> { Current.user }` - Automatically set creator to the current user

```ruby
message = Message.find(1)
message.room      # The Room object
message.creator   # The User who created it
```

### Example 3: Room has many messages

**Location:** `app/models/room.rb:21`

```ruby
class Room < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :messages, dependent: :destroy
end
```

The `dependent: :destroy` means: when a room is deleted, delete all its messages too.

```ruby
room = Room.find(1)
room.messages          # All messages in this room
room.messages.count    # How many messages
room.messages.create(body: "Hello!")  # Create a message IN this room
```

### The Association Map

Here's how Campfire's core models relate:

```
┌──────────┐         ┌─────────────┐         ┌──────────┐
│   User   │────────<│ Membership  │>────────│   Room   │
└──────────┘         └─────────────┘         └──────────┘
     │                                             │
     │ has_many                          has_many │
     ▼                                             ▼
┌──────────┐                               ┌──────────┐
│ Message  │>──────────────────────────────│ Message  │
│(creator) │                               │  (room)  │
└──────────┘                               └──────────┘
```

## Scopes: Reusable Query Fragments

Instead of writing the same `where` clause everywhere, define it once as a scope.

**Location:** `app/models/user.rb:17,23-24`

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }
  scope :ordered, -> { order("LOWER(name)") }
  scope :filtered_by, ->(query) { where("name like ?", "%#{query}%") }
end
```

Now you can chain them:

```ruby
User.active                        # All active users
User.active.ordered                # Active users, sorted by name
User.active.filtered_by("john")    # Active users with "john" in their name
```

**Why scopes matter:**

1. **Readability**: `User.active` is clearer than `User.where(active: true)`
2. **DRY**: Define once, use everywhere
3. **Chainable**: Combine scopes like building blocks
4. **Testable**: Test the scope in isolation

## Migrations: Evolving Your Database

Your database schema will change over time. Migrations track those changes.

**Location:** `db/migrate/20231220143106_add_bio_to_users.rb`

```ruby
class AddBioToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.2]
  def change
    change_table :users do |t|
      t.text :bio
    end
  end
end
```

**What this does:** Adds a `bio` column to the `users` table.

Run it with:
```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

**Why migrations are powerful:**

1. **Version control for your database** - Every change is tracked
2. **Reversible** - `bin/rails db:rollback` undoes the last migration
3. **Team-friendly** - Everyone runs the same migrations, gets the same schema
4. **No manual SQL** - Rails generates it for you

Common migration methods:
```ruby
add_column :users, :bio, :text
remove_column :users, :bio
rename_column :users, :bio, :biography
add_index :users, :email_address, unique: true
create_table :posts do |t|
  t.string :title
  t.text :body
  t.references :user, foreign_key: true
  t.timestamps
end
```

## Callbacks: Hooks Into the Lifecycle

Callbacks let you run code at specific moments in an object's life.

**Location:** `app/models/user.rb:21`

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  after_create_commit :grant_membership_to_open_rooms

  private
    def grant_membership_to_open_rooms
      Membership.insert_all(
        Rooms::Open.pluck(:id).collect { |room_id| { room_id: room_id, user_id: id } }
      )
    end
end
```

**What this does:** After a user is created and saved to the database, automatically add them to all open rooms.

**Location:** `app/models/message.rb:12`

```ruby
class Message < ApplicationRecord
  after_create_commit -> { room.receive(self) }
end
```

**What this does:** After a message is created, tell the room to "receive" it (which marks memberships as unread and queues push notifications).

**Common callbacks:**

| Callback | When it runs |
|----------|--------------|
| `before_validation` | Before validation runs |
| `after_validation` | After validation passes |
| `before_save` | Before save (create or update) |
| `after_save` | After save |
| `before_create` | Before first save (new record) |
| `after_create` | After first save |
| `after_create_commit` | After first save AND transaction commits |
| `before_destroy` | Before deletion |
| `after_destroy` | After deletion |

**Warning:** Callbacks can make code hard to follow. Use them for:
- Cross-cutting concerns (like our "add to open rooms" example)
- Things that MUST happen every time

Don't use them for business logic that might vary based on context.

## Try It Yourself

Open a Rails console (`bin/rails console`) and try these:

```ruby
# 1. Find a user and explore their associations
user = User.first
user.rooms
user.memberships
user.messages

# 2. Chain some queries
Room.where(type: "Rooms::Open").count
User.active.ordered.limit(5)

# 3. See the SQL ActiveRecord generates
User.where(active: true).to_sql
# => "SELECT \"users\".* FROM \"users\" WHERE \"users\".\"active\" = 1"

# 4. Explore a complex query
user.rooms.joins(:messages).where(messages: { created_at: 1.day.ago.. })
```

## Summary

- **ORM** (Object-Relational Mapper) translates between Ruby objects and database tables - Rails includes one (ActiveRecord), Next.js doesn't (bring your own)
- **Naming conventions** connect everything: `User` class → `users` table, no configuration needed
- **Associations** (`has_many`, `belongs_to`, `through`) let you navigate between related models with simple method calls
- **Scopes** are reusable query fragments that make your code readable and DRY
- **Migrations** version-control your database schema - every change is tracked and reversible
- **Callbacks** hook into lifecycle events, but use them sparingly

**The key insight:** ActiveRecord lets you think in objects, not tables. You say `user.rooms` and it figures out the JOIN. You say `message.create` and it generates the INSERT. The database becomes an implementation detail.

**Next up:** We'll explore Associations in depth - including polymorphic associations, counter caches, and the n+1 query problem that trips up every Rails developer.

## Q&A

### Q: Why doesn't Next.js ship with an ORM like Rails does?

Different philosophies:

**Rails philosophy:** "Convention over configuration." Make decisions for developers so they can move fast. Everyone does databases the same way, code is consistent across projects, onboarding is fast.

**Next.js philosophy:** "Flexibility over prescription." Don't force choices. Let developers pick what works for their needs - maybe they use Prisma, maybe Drizzle, maybe a headless CMS, maybe no database at all.

Neither is "right." Rails is opinionated and productive. Next.js is flexible and lets you choose. The tradeoff is: Rails developers spend less time choosing tools but have less flexibility; Next.js developers have complete freedom but must make more decisions.

When people say "Rails' ORM makes it powerful," they mean: ActiveRecord is so well-integrated that you rarely think about the database. You think in Ruby. The framework handles the translation. In Next.js, you're always aware you're using a separate tool (Prisma, etc.) that doesn't "know" about the rest of your app.

### Q: Why is the class singular (User) but the table plural (users)? Why not both the same?

The answer is surprisingly elegant - it's about making code read like English.

**Classes describe ONE thing**

When you define a class, you're describing what a single instance IS:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # I am describing what ONE user is and can do
  has_many :messages    # "A user has many messages"

  def greet
    "Hello, I am #{name}"  # ONE user greeting
  end
end
```

You'd never say "A Users has many messages" - that's grammatically wrong.

**Tables hold MANY things**

The `users` table is a container for ALL users. It's plural because it holds a collection:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;  -- Give me all the users
```

You wouldn't say "select from user" - that sounds like you're selecting from one person.

**It Makes Code Read Like English**

This is DHH's magic. Watch how natural this reads:

```ruby
User.find(1)           # "Find user 1"
User.all               # "All users" (from the users table)
User.where(active: true) # "Users where active is true"

user = User.first      # "The first user"
user.messages          # "This user's messages"
user.rooms             # "This user's rooms"
```

Compare to if both were singular:

```ruby
User.find(1)           # Still okay
User.all               # "All user"? Weird.
user.message           # "This user's message"? Just one?
```

Or if both were plural:

```ruby
Users.find(1)          # "Users find 1"? Finding multiple?
users = Users.first    # "users equals Users first"? Confusing.
```

**The Pattern Extends Everywhere**

| Concept | Singular | Plural | Why |
|---------|----------|--------|-----|
| Model class | `User` | - | Describes one thing |
| Table | - | `users` | Holds many things |
| Controller | - | `UsersController` | Handles requests about users (the collection) |
| Routes | - | `/users`, `/users/:id` | RESTful paths to the collection |
| Instance variable (one) | `@user` | - | Refers to one |
| Instance variable (many) | - | `@users` | Refers to many |
| Association (one) | `belongs_to :user` | - | This thing has ONE user |
| Association (many) | - | `has_many :users` | This thing has MANY users |

**Real Example from Campfire**

```ruby
# app/models/message.rb
class Message < ApplicationRecord        # ONE message
  belongs_to :room                       # has ONE room
  belongs_to :creator, class_name: "User" # has ONE creator
end

# app/models/room.rb
class Room < ApplicationRecord           # ONE room
  has_many :messages                     # has MANY messages
  has_many :users, through: :memberships # has MANY users
end
```

Reading this aloud: "A message belongs to a room. A room has many messages."

If it were `has_many :message`, you'd read "A room has many message" - grammatically broken.

**The Philosophy**

DHH (Rails creator) optimized for **developer happiness** and **code readability**. He wanted Rails code to read like a conversation about your domain, not like machine instructions.

This is why Rails has an `Inflector` that knows:
- `"user".pluralize` → `"users"`
- `"users".singularize` → `"user"`
- `"person".pluralize` → `"people"` (it knows irregular plurals!)
- `"octopus".pluralize` → `"octopi"`
