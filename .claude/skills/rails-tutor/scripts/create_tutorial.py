# {topic}

[TODO: Opening paragraph - Start with the WHY. What problem does this concept solve? Why should the learner care about this? Connect it to their goal of becoming a senior Rails engineer.

NOTE: Update the frontmatter 'prerequisites' field with up to 3 relevant past tutorials if this builds on previous concepts (e.g., [references/tutorials/2025-11-20-active-record-basics.md, references/tutorials/2025-11-22-callbacks.md]). Leave as empty array [] if this is foundational.]

## The Problem

[TODO: Describe a real scenario from this codebase where this concept matters. Make it concrete - not "callbacks are useful for X" but "look at this code in app/models/user.rb where we need to do Y - that's the problem this concept solves"]

## Key Concepts

[TODO: Build mental models, not just definitions. Use:
- Analogies that connect to things they already understand
- ASCII diagrams if helpful for visualizing relationships
- ELI5 explanations that get to the essence
- Break complex concepts into digestible pieces
- Predict and address likely points of confusion

Remember: Teach the "shape" of the concept, not just the syntax.]

## Examples from Codebase

[TODO: Include 2-4 real examples from this repository. For each example:

### Example 1: [Brief description]
**Location:** app/models/user.rb:25-30

```ruby
# Paste the relevant code snippet here
```

**What this demonstrates:** [Explain what's happening and why this is a good example of the concept]

Repeat for each example. Use actual file paths and line numbers. The more specific, the stickier the learning.]

## Try It Yourself

[TODO: Suggest a small exercise the learner could try in this codebase to practice the concept. Make it:
- Achievable in 10-15 minutes
- Directly related to the codebase they're working in
- Something that would genuinely improve their understanding

Delete this section if no practical exercise makes sense for this concept.]

## Summary

[TODO: Key takeaways - what should stick in their mind after this tutorial? 3-5 bullet points capturing:
- The core concept in one sentence
- When to use it
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- How it connects to their broader Rails learning journey]

---

## Q&A

[Questions and answers will be added here as the learner asks them during the tutorial]

## Quiz History

[Quiz sessions will be recorded here after the learner is quizzed on this topic]
